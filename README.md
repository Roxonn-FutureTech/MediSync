- Automated resource allocation
- Real-time status updates and notifications
- GPS-based routing and navigation

### Hospital Coordination
- Live bed availability tracking
- Department and specialty management
- Resource sharing between facilities
- Patient transfer coordination

### Staff Management
- Real-time staff availability tracking
- Shift management and scheduling
- Expertise-based assignment
- Performance monitoring

### Analytics and Reporting
- Response time analytics
- Resource utilization reports
- Performance metrics
- Trend analysis and predictions

## System Architecture

The project is structured into two main components:

### Frontend (/frontend)
- Modern Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- Built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI
- Real-time updates and offline support

- See [Frontend README](frontend/README.md) for details

### Backend (/backend)
- RESTful API service
- Real-time data processing
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Scalable microservices architecture
- Database management and optimization

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Material-UI v5
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Leaflet for mapping
- PWA capabilities

### Backend (Planned)
- Node.js/Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Redis for caching
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Docker containerization
